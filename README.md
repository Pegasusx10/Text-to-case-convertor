A text case generator is a tool that converts text from one case format to another. This generator specifically supports three common case formats: camel case, snake case, and kebab case.

Camel case is a format where each word is capitalized except for the first word, and the words are concatenated without separators. Example: "camelCase".

Snake case is a format where each word is separated by an underscore, and all letters are in lowercase. Example: "snake_case".

Kebab case is a format where each word is separated by a hyphen, and all letters are in lowercase. Example: "kebab-case".

With this generator, you can easily convert text between the three case formats, making it a useful tool for formatting and standardizing text in various applications.
